	<h2> A small strategy game about defending your pathway from dangerous invading balls </h2>

	<p>This is a <strong>Windows</strong> game done with a tutorial by <a href="https://twitter.com/BrackeysTweet?">Brackeys</a>.
	All assets were done by him in <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> and blender is an open source free platform that allows you to create 3D/2D models/images, animations, pictures and much more

	<p>This is the first version on it so there are lots of bugs and glitches in the game so v2.0 or v1.5 will come out soon so please play test this and give feedback on the game</p>
